%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 2: Intro
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this presentation, we want to analyze the results of the US 2020 election in 5 US MidWest states.
\item We compare this to the 2016 elections and the demography of these states.
\item Only the Republican and Democratic presidential results are considered.
\item The 2020 election data was obtained from the Harvard Dataverse, the 2016 election data was scraped using the New York Times API, and the census data was obtained from the tidycensus API in R software.
\item The figures and tables were generated using the R software.
\end{itemize}

There was more than 20 million votes in 2020 compared to 2016 and this reflected in positive changes in votes in almost all counties considered. However, the maximum votes change in the counties considered was just 17,106 with the minimum being -2,517.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 12-13: Implications
\begin{frame}{What the regression results mean for elections going forward}
\begin{itemize}

\item From the tables above, a percentage change in White population negatively and significantly affected the change in votes of both Republicans and Democrats. However, the Democrats were affected more. According to an article on Asam News, White population "feel like a minority group that is in decline, and they feel that people of color are rising while they are declining” (Sohrabji, 2020). Trump's policies were perceived as anti-immigration and the White population therefore identifies with him more.

\item A percentage change in Male population also negatively and but insignificantly affect the change in votes of both Republicans and Democrats. But the Democrats were less affected.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What the regression results mean for elections going forward}
\begin{itemize}

\item Minnesota and Wisconsin have positive and significant effects on the vote change for Republicans and Democrats. A lot of attention should be given to these states.

\item Iowa has a positive and significant effect on Republican votes but positive and insignificant effect on Democrat votes.

\item Going forward, both parties need to develop strategies on how to allay the fears of the White population and make them feel the country belongs to them. The male population also deserve attention especially in terms of more job creation.

\end{itemize}
